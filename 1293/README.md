It’s restless now on the slipways of the sixth dock of the intergalactic port of the planet Torna. In just a month, the reconstruction of the small armored corvette Enya will be completed. Once again, this warship and her valiant crew will face tough battles for control of the Sibelius plutonium mines. The work does not stop for a second; laser welding machines work around the clock. The joints of repair robots melt due to continuous work. But you can’t linger for a second.
And in this turmoil it is discovered that the thermal protective panels of the corvette again require urgent treatment with thorium sulfide. It is known that 1 nanogram of sulfide is required to process one square meter of panel. In total, N rectangular panels measuring A by B meters need to be processed. You need to calculate as soon as possible how much sulfide is needed to treat all Enya panels. And don't forget that the panels require processing on both sides.
Initial data
The only line contains the integers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100), A (1 ≤ A ≤ 100), B (1 ≤ B ≤ 100).
Result
Print the weight of thorium sulfide required for processing in nanograms.
