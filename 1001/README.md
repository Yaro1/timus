This problem is so simple that the authors were even too lazy to write a condition for it!
Initial data
The input stream contains a set of integers Ai (0 ≤ Ai ≤ 1018), separated from each other by an arbitrary number of spaces and line breaks. The input stream size does not exceed 256 KB.
Result
For each number Ai, starting from the last and ending with the first, print in a separate line its square root with at least four digits after the decimal point.
