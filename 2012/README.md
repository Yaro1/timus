Grisha N. told his two teammates that even if they did not come to the quarterfinals of the World Championship, he would solve all the proposed problems at the competition. Grisha's teammates didn't believe him, and then he told them the plan of how he was going to do it.
In the first hour he wants to solve f problems. If there is still time left before the end of the first hour, Grisha will simply go for a walk along the corridor. Starting from the second hour, Grisha wants to spend exactly 45 minutes on each of the remaining tasks. If Grisha's plan succeeds, will he be able to solve all 12 proposed problems in 5 hours of competition?
