Bandits Harry and Larry were relaxing in nature. Having decided to shoot, they placed several beer cans (no more than 10) on a log. Harry began shooting through the cans in order, starting with the one on the left, Larry - with the one on the right. At some point it turned out that they simultaneously shot through the same last can.
Harry was indignant and said that Larry owed him a lot of money for depriving him of the pleasure of shooting through some cans. Larry responded by saying that Harry owed him even more money for the same reasons. They began to argue about who owed whom how much, but none of them remembered how many cans there were at the beginning, and they were reluctant to look for bullet-ridden cans throughout the area. Each of them only remembered how many cans he himself had shot through.
Using these data, determine how many cans Harry did not shoot through and how many cans Larry did not shoot through.
Initial data
The only line contains 2 numbers - the number of cans shot through by Harry and Larry, respectively.
Result
Print 2 numbers â€” the number of cans not shot through by Harry and Larry, respectively.
